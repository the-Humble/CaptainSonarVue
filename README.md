Vue.js implementation of the popular 8 player tabletop strategy game "Captain Sonar"

[demo] (https://github.com/the-Humble/CaptainSonarVue)


## Synopsis
---------------
This is an incomplete implementation of the popular tabletop game Captain Sonar. In this implementation, we focus on the use of Vue components to create an easy to understand interface for the game. This interface has been updated to include basic functionality for its layout, but game logic is still a work in progress
Teams can now be created
Basic Server implementations and functions have been added

Jose Ignacio Ferrer Vera - Programmer and Designer
Scott Henshaw - Created Template

# *** How to use ***
---------------------------------------
Instructions to play Captain Sonar can be found at: https://www.matagot.com/IMG/pdf/SONAR_RULES_EN_lr.pdf
To use this application, up to 8 devices must be connected to a session
Make sure to create only one user per connected device

The game is played by turns, and teams must make their moves at the same time as the oopponent, but wait until everyone is ready to progress.


# *** Caveats *** (optional)
---------------------------------------
Game logic and networking has to be implemented
All opf the interfaces work, but there is no communication beyond the locval level.

## VueAppTemplate

Base template for HTML5/CSS3 app using latest ES2017 JavaScript on Vue.js framework.

This HTML5 App template is ES2015+ compliant, will run in all browsers natively without the need for any "compiler" or 3rd party pre-processing solution (Babel, Node, Broswerify, etc NOT required).

Modern browsers continue to evolve and extend the basic functionality and as of ES2017 full module support, class (style) based inheritance, scoping are all available to make it easy for non JavaScript programmers to get into JavaScript.

This HTML5 App also uses CSS3 Grid Layouts with Flexbox.

## Getting Started
In this application, the use of components is an imitation of Vue's "single page component" or "SPC". I say an imitation because due to the reliance of SPCs to "dependencies"/"modules" (webpack, npm, etc..), I've created a workaround of this app's components. It is represented as javascript class objects which takes in Vue's "Vue.component" in the constructor.

All the components have color coded borders:
* MainRootComponent = Red solid border
* Components = Green solid border
* Sub-Components = Light Green dashed border
### Main Component
MainComponent.js behaves a bit differently for it is a Vue.component but also has a Vue Root, all components declared in this component is declared globally.

### HTML and Styling
* All the "wrapper" is in a form of CSS GRID Layout.
* Each CSS GRID "area" has a "container" in a form of "flexbox".
* And each CSS Flexbox "container" contains "flexitems".

Application's HTML5 Structure:
All the "wrapper" is in a form of CSS GRID Layout.
Each grid "area" has a "container" in a form of "flexbox".
And each flexbox "container" contains "flexitems".

All of the traditional, functional traits of JavaScript are mantained but made easier to access as beginners and programmers coming from other languages.

Enjoy this base template.
