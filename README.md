# VueAppTemplate

Base template for HTML5/CSS3 app using latest ES2017 JavaScript on Vue.js framework.

This HTML5 App template is ES2015+ compliant, will run in all browsers natively without the need for any "compiler" or 3rd party pre-processing solution (Babel, Node, Broswerify, etc NOT required).

Modern browsers continue to evolve and extend the basic functionality and as of ES2017 full module support, class (style) based inheritance, scoping are all available to make it easy for non JavaScript programmers to get into JavaScript.

This HTML5 App also uses CSS3 Grid Layouts with Flexbox.

## Getting Started
In this application, the use of components is an imitation of Vue's "single page component" or "SPC". I say an imitation because due to the reliance of SPCs to "dependencies"/"modules" (webpack, npm, etc..), I've created a workaround of this app's components. It is represented as javascript class objects which takes in Vue's "Vue.component" in the constructor.

All the components have color coded borders:
* MainRootComponent = Red solid border
* Components = Green solid border
* Sub-Components = Light Green dashed border
### Main Component
MainComponent.js behaves a bit differently for it is a Vue.component but also has a Vue Root, all components declared in this component is declared globally.

### HTML and Styling
* All the "wrapper" is in a form of CSS GRID Layout.
* Each CSS GRID "area" has a "container" in a form of "flexbox".
* And each CSS Flexbox "container" contains "flexitems".

Application's HTML5 Structure:
All the "wrapper" is in a form of CSS GRID Layout.
Each grid "area" has a "container" in a form of "flexbox".
And each flexbox "container" contains "flexitems".

All of the traditional, functional traits of JavaScript are mantained but made easier to access as beginners and programmers coming from other languages.
